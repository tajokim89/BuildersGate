# Setup in full

2026-07-27. The [README](../README.md) has the short version. This page has the
rest: API keys, adopting an existing game, switching projects, registering the
MCP server, and platform detail.

## Requirements

| Thing | Needed for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Python 3.11+ | everything | `pip install -e .` pulls mcp, fastapi, uvicorn, Pillow, openai |
| An MCP client | agents | This checkout uses the local Codex CLI |
| [Godot 4.x](https://godotengine.org) | the core loop | On macOS the expected path is `/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot`, or set `BGATE_GODOT` |
| Godot Web export templates | `bgate publish` | A separate ~1 GB download from inside the editor |
| [Blender 4.2+](https://blender.org) | the 3D leg, optional | Or set `BGATE_BLENDER` |
| `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` on PATH | playtest capture, optional | Screen capture, frame extraction, reading a recording's duration |
| `faster-whisper` + `sounddevice` | playtest transcription, optional | `pip install -e ".[stt,record]"` |

## API keys: two image providers, either or both

The art seat needs at least one. Copy [`.env.example`](../.env.example) to
`.env` **at your game project's root** and fill in what you have.

| Variable | Provider | What it buys |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI `gpt-image` | Portraits, UI, backdrops, reference-first sprite sets. Prices by quality tier. |
| `KREA_API_KEY` | [Krea](https://krea.ai) | A catalogue of 14 models (Flux, Imagen, Nano Banana, Krea-2) behind one key, with `image_style_references` as a first-class input. That input is exactly what the art seat's pinned anchors are. Prices per model, per request. |

Neither provider returns usable transparency. Measured:
`background="transparent"` came back as a brown gradient. Sprite work goes
through the chroma-key path in `bgate_core/chroma.py` either way. The module
docstring in `bgate_adapters/krea.py` has the full comparison.

`.env` and `.env.*` are gitignored here and in every project `bgate init` stamps
out. They were not, for a while, which is how following these instructions
committed a key. Keys are loaded per-project and never logged.

You can also set these from the dashboard — **Settings → Art providers**, or the
**Generators** tab on Studio. Either writes the key into this same gitignored
`.env` (adding the ignore rule first if the project is missing it) and makes it
live without a restart. `bgate doctor`'s `art_key` row is green when any
provider has a key.

## Platform support

**macOS is the verified platform for this checkout.** The verified path is
`bgate serve` in a browser, local Codex CLI for agents, Codex MCP registration,
Godot headless checks, and optional Tailscale Serve for tailnet access.

**Windows remains a compatibility and release-packaging surface.** The
standalone Windows zip and Windows capture details are not part of the Mac mini
baseline.

**Linux is best-effort.** CI runs the suite there but marks it
`continue-on-error`. Treat Linux failures as useful reports, not as a guaranteed
supported path.

## bgate doctor

```bash
bgate doctor              # python/key/ffmpeg/ffprobe/blender/godot/whisper
bgate doctor --json
```

One pass, exits 1 if anything on the list is unavailable. That is the right
behaviour for a CI step and a slightly alarming one for a human: you only need
Python and Godot for the core loop. Read the rows, not the exit code.

It never opens the microphone, launches an engine, or spends money. Every probe
is wall-clock bounded and reports `{available, path, version, min_required,
reason}`. It also checks for the Web export templates specifically, because
without them the export fails with an error that reads like a broken preset.

## Already have a game? `bgate adopt`

`bgate init` scaffolds into a NEW directory. If you already have a Godot project,
adopt it instead.

```bash
cd my-existing-game
bgate adopt --pitch "what this game is"   # or: bgate adopt path/to/game
```

Adoption is additive only. It never copies a template file and never rewrites a
byte you wrote. It:

- creates `.bgate/game.db`
- merges the API-key ignore rules into your existing `.gitignore`, inside a
  marked block
- appends an `AGENTS.md` briefing the same way
- prints what it detected: Godot version, main scene, 2D vs 3D, and scene,
  script and asset counts

Safe to re-run. The second run refreshes the marked blocks in place instead of
stacking a second copy.

## AGENTS.md

Both `init` and `adopt` stamp an `AGENTS.md` into the project. That file is the
instructions for the Codex session working in *your game*: what a seat is, how a
work item is created and closed, what the bible and lore are for, the art
pipeline, and what not to do. It is the first thing to read.

## Switching between projects

```bash
bgate projects                    # every known project, * marks the active one
bgate use emberfall               # by registered name, or by directory
```

`bgate use` writes a pointer to `~/.bgate/active.json`. That file is user-scoped
and never in the repo, so `bgate serve`, `bgate doctor` and the MCP tools pick it
up without you exporting `BGATE_ROOT` in every shell.

The pointer is the LOWEST-priority answer on purpose. Resolution order:

1. an explicit `project_dir=` on a tool call
2. `BGATE_ROOT`
3. standing inside a project directory
4. the pointer

`project_select` is deprecated and switches nothing. It used to mutate a
module-level active root, which made "which game does this call affect" a
function of call order.

## Registering the MCP server

```bash
codex mcp add builders-gate -- <abs-python> -m bgate_mcp.server
```

Registration must use the ABSOLUTE python path from the Builders Gate virtual
environment. A bare `python` can resolve to a different interpreter when Codex
starts the MCP server and make a working server look disconnected.

`hook-install` is a legacy hook path. Do not use it as the default macOS Codex
setup. Codex gets the MCP server through `codex mcp add`, and project rules
through `AGENTS.md`.

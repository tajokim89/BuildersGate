"""The brainstorm room's thinking partner: a real CLI session that cannot write.

WHAT CHANGED AND WHY IT MATTERS. The room used to talk to a bare
chat-completions endpoint, and "a message cannot dispatch" was nearly free
there: that call is a messages array and a reply, with no tools to leave out.
The human asked for a spawned Claude Code session instead — a thinking partner
that is the same thing the rest of this product runs on — and a Claude Code
session has Write, Edit and Bash from its first token and inherits every MCP
server registered on the machine, INCLUDING builders-gate and its queue_add.

So the guarantee had to be re-established on a new basis rather than reworded.
It is re-established by REMOVING THE CAPABILITY, not by asking the session not
to use it: see runners._CLAUDE_READONLY, which is the argv, and
runners.CLAUDE_READONLY_BY, which is the sentence shown to a human who asks why
they should believe it. Both were checked against the CLI's own `system/init`
event — the one place that reports the tool list and the MCP servers the process
actually constructed. It said `"tools":[]` and `"mcp_servers":[]`, and a session
asked to write a file wrote none. The model's own account of its tools is NOT
evidence and was observed not to be: asked to list them at a session whose init
said `"tools":[]`, it recited the standard fifteen from memory.

THE BUILDERS-GATE MCP SERVER IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, AND A TWO-TOOL ONE IS NOT.
bible_read, lore_list and scope_check would each make this a better partner, and
registering the server is one call to runners.mcp_overrides(). It is not made,
because that helper registers the WHOLE server: queue_add, bible_add,
lore_update, image_generate (real money) and blender_run (executes a script). An
allowlist naming eight readers out of a hundred and fifty tools would put the
room's entire promise on nobody ever mistyping one entry. What those readers
would have supplied is supplied instead by brainstorm.world_context(), which
renders the pillars, the cut line and the established canon as prose.

What could NOT be supplied that way is the human's own pads, which change while
the conversation is happening — a partner that cannot see the diagram beside it
is answering with one eye shut. So the answer is a SMALL server rather than a
filtered big one: bgate_mcp.padserver, two tools, one session, no queue and no
filesystem. Registered through --mcp-config with --strict-mcp-config, which
together are an exhaustive statement rather than a preference.

ONE PROCESS PER SESSION, HELD OPEN BETWEEN MESSAGES, AND RESUMED WHEN IT IS NOT.
A brainstorm is a conversation, so each message is a turn in the same session.
That is `prompt_via == "stream"`: stdin stays open, one `result` event comes back
per turn, and the process waits for the next one. When the process is gone — the
dashboard restarted, the room was closed, an idle reap — reopening resumes the
CLI's OWN session by id rather than replaying a transcript into a blank one.
Re-seeding is still there and still correct, as the FALLBACK for every way a
resume can legitimately fail; see _resume_failed.

TWO CHANNELS OFF ONE TURN, and keeping them apart is what stops the terminal
view and the voice feature fighting:

    the TERMINAL channel   every event the CLI emitted, raw NDJSON on disk,
                           served by feed() for the transcript view. Tool calls,
                           results, run boundaries, the lot.
    the SPOKEN channel     the turn's final assistant prose and nothing else —
                           `result.text` from ask(). It is what is stored as the
                           assistant message and what text-to-speech is handed.

They come from the same `result` event and they are not the same thing. Speaking
the terminal channel would read tool JSON out loud; showing only the spoken
channel would make the transcript view a duplicate of the chat pane.

NOTHING HERE IMPORTS bgate_ui.dispatch, on purpose. The two modules spawn
processes the same way and share nothing else: dispatch's whole job is to give
an agent the tool set this one exists to withhold, and the two small parsers
below are copied rather than imported so that the brainstorm path cannot be one
refactor away from holding the dispatcher.

    THE RULE IS DELIBERATELY CRUDE: a process spawned with --resume that dies
    before landing a single successful turn is treated as a failed resume,
    whatever it said on the way out.

    A first attempt matched on wording — "no conversation", "session not found"
    — and it did not fire against the real thing. A deliberately corrupted
    session id produced `error_during_execution` and nothing else: the CLI has
    no machine-readable "that session is gone", and the sentence it chooses is
    not ours to depend on. The same attempt also gated on ``turns``, which
    counts BILLED turns and had already been incremented by the failed attempt's
    own token usage, so the guard disarmed itself.

    So: ``ok_turns`` (successful turns only), and no word matching. Once one
    turn has landed the session demonstrably exists and a later failure is a
    real failure that must never be laundered into a silent restart. Before
    that, the cost of a false positive is one replayed conversation and the cost
    of a false negative is a room that is permanently broken for the user whose
    session store was pruned.

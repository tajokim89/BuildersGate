"""Auto-deploy — the hands-off handoff between agents.

A delegation produces children: the director splits one ask into five queued
items and then stops. Somebody has to press dispatch on each of them, and while
nobody does, the board sits full of work with no agent on it. That pause is the
whole reason a five-seat floor feels like a to-do list instead of a studio.

This is the loop that removes it. While it is ON, every queued item is
dispatched as a slot frees up — priority first, oldest first inside a priority —
so a director's children fire the moment the parent finishes and the QA gate's
follow-ups fire the moment they are filed.

Runs as a daemon thread inside the dashboard, the same shape as qa_gate: core
stays pure data, spawning agents stays a UI-server concern.

Three things it deliberately does NOT do:

  * It never dispatches a ``qa-gate-escalation``. That item exists precisely
    because two agents could not agree and a human has to decide; auto-spending
    another agent on it is the money pump the escalation was invented to stop.
  * It never retries a refused item on the next tick. dispatch() refuses for
    real reasons (dirty tree, budget, scope, concurrency) and a 4-second retry
    loop against a dirty tree is a hot loop that writes nothing but noise. A
    refused item goes on a cooldown; a refusal that is about the FLOOR rather
    than the item (concurrency, budget, a dirty tree) ends the tick.
  * It never hides a refusal. The last one is kept and served with the state,
    because an autopilot that is quietly doing nothing looks exactly like an
    autopilot that is working and has nothing to do — and the first person to
    hit that spends ten minutes wondering why the board is frozen.

The switch itself is persisted per project (workspace doc ``director/autopilot``)
so it survives a restart, and read fresh on every tick so flipping it in one tab
takes effect everywhere.

IT IS READ THROUGH ``bgate_core.settings`` (key ``autopilot.on``) — same doc,
same field, one precedence rule. The reason that matters here is
``BGATE_AUTODEPLOY``: it decides whether the thread starts, so a project whose
stored switch says ON looked ON in the console while nothing was ever dispatched.
The registry makes that var coerce the value it is really controlling, and
``state()`` now says which layer won.

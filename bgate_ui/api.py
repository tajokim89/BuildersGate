"""The HTTP contract every route module shares.

The QA audit's loudest cross-cutting finding: two mutually exclusive error
conventions coexisted (FastAPI's ``{detail}`` at 4xx and ``200 {ok: false,
error}``), so the frontend gave up and wrapped every fetch in
``.catch(() => ({}))`` — which does not even fire on a 500, because a 500 body
is still valid JSON. Every failure in the product rendered as a blank panel.

One envelope, always::

    {"ok": true,  "data": <payload>}
    {"ok": false, "error": {"code": "not_found", "message": "...", "detail": {...}}}

``code`` is machine-readable and stable; ``message`` is a sentence a human can
act on. Handlers raise :class:`ApiError` (or any HTTPException — it is coerced)
and never hand-roll an error body.

Also here because every router needs it and nobody should re-derive it:
pagination, the actor identity that makes reviews accountable, and the
same-origin + bearer-token guard on the mutating surface.

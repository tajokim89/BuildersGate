/* agents_graph.js — the live delegation graph on the Agents console.
 *
 * The board this replaces could show you five lanes of cards and never once
 * show you that item #38 exists BECAUSE you asked for a desk-clutter set, or
 * that #41 is sitting behind a QA gate nobody opened. Those relations were all
 * in the database (work_item.source/source_ref, the DELEGATED-FROM line, the
 * qa-gate rows) and nowhere on screen.
 *
 * So: one tree, one incoming edge per node, columns left to right.
 *
 *     you said …   →   seat   →   task   →   handoff   →   gate
 *
 * A task whose parent is another task hangs off the PARENT rather than its
 * seat, which is what makes a handoff visible as a handoff.
 *
 * A gate hangs off work that is STILL IN FLIGHT. A candidate from a run that
 * finished last week is a review backlog (Assets owns that), not something the
 * floor is blocked on, and hanging it here made the graph look permanently
 * jammed. The server filters that; this file just draws what it is sent.
 *
 * Everything else here is upkeep: patch nodes in place so a drag survives a
 * poll, keep positions in the project's workspace doc, and never throw — the
 * graph is a reading of the floor, and a reading that crashes takes the console
 * with it.
 *
 * Data comes from /api/console/state, polled by agents_console.js and pushed in
 * through apply(). This module makes no requests of its own except the ones a
 * button press causes.

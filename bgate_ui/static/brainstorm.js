/* Brainstorm workspace — the cheap room, with three surfaces and one Deploy.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. A chat thread, a writing pad and a drawing pad side by side,
 * plus a Deploy button that is deliberately TWO steps: synthesize proposes a
 * plan and writes nothing, and only an explicit confirm files it. Backed by
 * bgate_core/brainstorm.py through bgate_ui/routes/brainstorm.py.
 *
 * MOUNT CONTRACT — one call, from a seat module's render():
 *
 *     Brainstorm.mount(container, { seat: "director" });
 *     Brainstorm.mount(container, { seat: "narrative" });
 *
 * `seat` is the only parameter. It picks which sessions are listed, which seat
 * new sessions are created under, and what the server is allowed to file from
 * them — a narrative brainstorm may only propose narrative work, enforced
 * server-side in ALLOWED_SEATS, not here. There is no narrative fork of this
 * module and there must not be one; the two variants differ by a string and a
 * few labels, and the moment they are two files they start drifting on which
 * one remembered to flush the notes pad before deploying.
 *
 * WHY THE DRAWING PAD IS HAND-BUILT AND NOT EXCALIDRAW.
 *
 * Excalidraw was the ask, and the reason it is not here is measured, not
 * assumed. @excalidraw/excalidraw 0.18.1:
 *
 *   prod JS + CSS (index + 3 chunks)     2.80 MB
 *   prod/fonts (Excalifont, Nunito, …)  14.00 MB
 *   react 18.3.1 + react-dom UMD         0.14 MB
 *   -----------------------------------------------
 *   realistic vendored floor            ~17 MB, against a 3.6 MB static tree
 *
 * Size alone might be arguable. This is not: dist/prod/index.js is pure ESM
 * that imports twenty bare specifiers — @radix-ui/react-popover, jotai, pako,
 * perfect-freehand, nanoid, clsx, browser-fs-access, fractional-indexing and
 * the rest. A browser cannot resolve any of them without an import map over
 * the whole transitive tree or a bundler, and index.html's rule is "no build
 * step, no node, no CDN". React 18 still ships UMD; React 19 dropped it, so
 * even the shim route is already deprecated.
 *
 * So the pad below is purpose-built and emits EXCALIDRAW-SHAPED ELEMENTS —
 * typed shapes with real geometry, ids, labels and arrow bindings, never
 * strokes-as-pixels. That is what makes the model able to read the drawing:
 * brainstorm.drawing_digest() walks el.type / el.id / el.x,y,w,h /
 * el.text|el.label.text / el.startBinding.elementId and turns it into lines,
 * and everything this pad writes is in exactly those fields. Shapes carry
 * `label: {text}` rather than a separate bound-text element because that is
 * both what the digest reads AND what Excalidraw's own
 * convertToExcalidrawElements() accepts as input — so swapping in the real
 * thing later is a component swap, not a data migration. Same reason the scene
 * is wrapped as {type:"excalidraw", version:2, elements, appState}.
 *
 * The model can write elements BACK through PATCH /api/brainstorm/{id}
 * {drawing:{...}}; this pad renders whatever the session holds, so an agent
 * that adds a box is just a reload away from being visible.
 *
 * Vanilla JS, no deps. Self-contained: injects its own <style>, touches no
 * other module's DOM, and uses window.Split (split.js) and window.BGIcon only
 * if they are present.

   * VOICE — talking to the agent, and hearing it answer.
   *
   * WHY THE MIC TALKS TO OUR OWN SERVER AND NOT TO DEEPGRAM. Deepgram's
   * realtime socket is normally opened by the client holding the API key. That
   * would put DEEPGRAM_API_KEY in this file, in the devtools console and in the
   * DOM. So the browser streams to /api/voice/listen on the dashboard and the
   * SERVER relays — see bgate_ui/routes/voice.py for the full argument,
   * including why Deepgram's short-lived /v1/auth/grant token lost. Nothing in
   * this module has ever seen a provider key and there is no field it could
   * arrive in.
   *
   * THE AUDIO CONTRACT IS THE SERVER'S. /api/voice/status serves encoding,
   * sample_rate and channels, and Mic honours whatever comes back rather than
   * hardcoding 16000 in two places that can drift. Wrong rate is the classic
   * failure here and it does not error — it transcribes as chipmunks.
   *
   * WHY interim VS final MATTERS. Deepgram sends three grades of result and
   * conflating them makes the feature unusable:
   *   final=false        a guess, revised as you keep talking. PAINT it.
   *   final=true         this segment is settled; the sentence may continue.
   *   speech_final=true  the human stopped. THIS is what becomes a message.
   * Sending on `final` instead would fire a chat message per clause.
   *
   * THE MIC BEING LIVE IS NEVER SUBTLE. An always-listening panel with no
   * signal is a privacy problem wearing a feature's clothes, so a hot mic gets
   * a full-width bar over the composer, a pulsing dot, the words being heard,
   * and a button that has visibly changed state. Every exit path — stop,
   * Escape, a socket error, unmounting the workspace, switching sessions —
   * goes through Mic.stop(), which stops the MediaStream tracks so the
   * browser's own recording indicator goes out too.

   * THE WRITING PAD — a toolbar over a textarea, and MARKDOWN STAYS THE STORE.
   *
   * WHY NOT A RICH-TEXT EDITOR. The notes column is text and three things read
   * it as markdown: the synthesis prompt, the preview button, and — since the
   * partner became a spawned session — pad_read on the scoped MCP server. A
   * contenteditable storing HTML would make all three worse, and the one that
   * matters most is the third: a model handed markdown reads a document, and a
   * model handed serialised HTML reads soup. So this inserts markdown INTO the
   * textarea and the textarea remains the truth. Typing `- ` by hand keeps
   * working, because nothing here intercepts typing.
   *
   * WHY NOT TIPTAP / PROSEMIRROR / QUILL. index.html states the rule and the
   * CSP enforces it: no build step, no npm, no CDN. Vendoring ProseMirror is
   * ~400KB of someone else's code into a repo that purpose-built its own
   * drawing pad for exactly this reason. Measured against what a scratchpad
   * needs, it is not close.
   *
   * WHAT WAS CUT FROM THE REFERENCE TOOLBAR, and why — it is another product's
   * list, not a specification:
   *   tables      markdown tables are painful to edit by hand in a textarea and
   *               a scratchpad is not where anyone lays out a grid. A table
   *               button that produces a skeleton nobody can then maintain is
   *               worse than no button.
   *   callouts    not standard markdown. It would render in our preview and
   *               nowhere else, including in the model's reading of the pad.
   *   import /    sessions ARE the document model here: the browser, archive
   *   export /    and new-session already exist and are backed by the DB. A
   *   new doc     second document concept beside brainstorm sessions is the
   *               thing this pad must not grow.
   * KEPT: bold, italic, strike, inline code, H1-H3, bullet/numbered/checklist,
   * quote, code block, link, rule. Each one is a line or a wrap, each one is
   * markdown somebody might have typed anyway.

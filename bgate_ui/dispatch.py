"""Dispatch — the dashboard spawns real Claude seat sessions against work items.

Why this architecture wins: a session spawned with cwd = the game project gets
(1) the builders-gate MCP tools NATIVELY (the server resolves the project by
cwd — no runner scripts, no kwargs files), and (2) the PreToolUse lane/lock
hook with BGATE_SEAT set — actual enforcement, not honor-system. The dashboard
is user-run software, so a dispatch click is the USER launching the agent.

One live session per work item; state is in-memory plus a log file per item
(.bgate/agents/item-<id>.log) so a dashboard restart loses handles, not history.

Who writes what, because getting this wrong cost us the whole lifecycle once:
status() and read_activity() are READS — the dashboard polls them every few
seconds and they must not touch the DB. Everything that settles a run
(_reap/_trip/sweep/reconcile) is driven by the per-run watchdog thread, or
called explicitly at startup, so a run finishes correctly whether or not
anybody has a browser tab open.

# ran `find / -iname godot*.exe` against the whole filesystem — one of them with
# no -maxdepth at all. They were still walking 22 minutes later, ~20 CPU-minutes
# each, having outlived the agents that started them; nothing was left to read
# their output. The search was never needed. find_godot() checks a handful of
# known install roots and BGATE_GODOT short-circuits even that.
#
# The cost is not the CPU. A drive-wide find outruns the Bash tool's timeout, so
# the agent gets nothing back, tries again with different flags, and each of
# those turns re-sends the entire context — the same mechanism the SPEND TURNS
# section below was written for. An agent searches when nobody handed it a path,
# so this hands it the path.

# Successes are cached, misses are NOT: a dashboard left running while the user
# installs Blender should pick it up on the next dispatch rather than at the
# next restart. A finder that raises is not fatal here — a project with no
# Blender still dispatches every seat that never calls it, and the adapter

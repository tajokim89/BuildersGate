"""Which CLI a dispatched agent actually runs on.

Dispatch was one CLI hardcoded in one function: `claude`, with claude's flags,
emitting claude's stream-json, parsed by a reader that knew those event names.
That was correct while there was one runner and became the obstacle the moment
there were two.

WHY A SECOND RUNNER AT ALL, given the first one works: the Codex CLI generates
images natively. Every other seat wants the engine, the parser and the ledger
this tool already has; the art seat is the one place where the runner's OWN
capability is the point. So this is deliberately not "pluggable agents" — it is
one seat, one alternative, and a table that says exactly how the two differ.

WHAT A RUNNER MUST DECLARE, because dispatch's behaviour depends on all four
and guessing any of them produces a silent failure rather than an error:

    steerable      claude keeps stdin open as a live channel, so agent_steer can
                   inject a user turn mid-run. `codex exec` reads stdin ONCE, as
                   an appended block, and closes it. A steer sent to a Codex
                   agent goes nowhere, so the caller has to be told rather than
                   left watching a message that will never land.

    cost_tracked   claude reports total_cost_usd per turn, which is what the
                   per-item ceiling at _observed_cost kills a runaway on. Codex
                   reports TOKENS and no price. A price table would be a number
                   in this repo going stale against OpenAI's, silently
                   under-reporting until somebody notices the bill — so there
                   is none, the ceiling is declared not to apply, and the run
                   says so everywhere it is shown. An untracked cost that
                   ANNOUNCES itself is recoverable; one that reads as $0.00 is
                   the thing that empties an account overnight.

    prompt_via     "stream" keeps the pipe open for the life of the run;
                   "stdin_once" writes the prompt and closes, which is the only
                   thing `codex exec` will act on.

    events         the log parser needs to know which vocabulary it is reading.
                   The two do not collide (`assistant`/`user`/`result` versus
                   `thread.started`/`item.completed`/`turn.completed`), so one
                   reader handles a log of either kind without being told which.

THE SANDBOX IS NOT BYPASSED. Codex runs under `--sandbox workspace-write` with
`--cd` at the project, which was verified to write to the real directory rather
than the sandbox's shadow copy. That distinction is worth stating because the
shadow is the default OUTSIDE a git repo: a run started with
`--skip-git-repo-check` on a non-repo directory reports every write as
successful and leaves the real tree untouched. `requires_git_repo` is that
finding turned into a precondition.

#                           a feature that silently does nothing reads as the
#                           model being unhelpful. The guarantee never rested on
#                           plan mode anyway — it rests on the tool set being
#                           empty and the MCP config being exhaustive, both of
#                           which are unchanged and both of which were read back

#   --no-session-persistence
#                           it was here on the reasoning that the transcript
#                           already lives in the project's DB and a second copy
#                           of somebody's private thinking under ~/.claude is a
#                           copy nobody asked for. That lost to a direct request
#                           — "proper cli emulation for seamless resumes" —
#                           because the flag and --resume are one switch read
#                           two ways: a session that was never persisted cannot
#                           be resumed, and re-seeding a transcript into a fresh
#                           process is a replay, not a continuation. The trade
#                           is stated rather than hidden.
#
# WHAT THE ROOM'S PROMISE NOW RESTS ON, in one sentence, because two flags left
# and one arrived and it should be possible to check without reading all of the
# above: the process holds exactly two tools, both of which write to one row of
# one table in this project's own database, and neither of which can file work,
# run a command or touch a file.

# The two tools the pad server exposes, by their full CLI-side names. Imported
# from nowhere on purpose: bgate_mcp.padserver pulls in the MCP SDK, and this

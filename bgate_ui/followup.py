"""The follow-up router — one subscriber that decides what happens after a finish.

WHAT WAS BROKEN. An agent finished and nobody was told. Under the agent gate a
QA reviewer was spawned; under the builder's gate the item parked in ``review``;
in both cases the DIRECTOR — the seat that owns what happens next — heard
nothing, the chain advanced silently, and a human who was not staring at the
right console view found out later or not at all. Three features were needed to
fix that (spawn the reviewer, debrief the director, ring something), and the
established shape in this tree would have made each of them a daemon thread with
its own cutoff, its own cooldown and its own copy of "recent". ``qa_gate`` is the
cost of that shape: it reviewed only transitions after the server started, so
every completion that happened while the dashboard was down was never reviewed
and nothing said so.

So this is ONE subscriber on ONE cursor over ``bgate_core.events``, and it
absorbs ``qa_gate``'s loop rather than sitting next to it. Being cursor-driven is
what closes the startup hole: the cursor is a row id, so a dashboard that was off
for an hour resumes exactly where it stopped instead of pretending the hour did
not happen.

THE FIVE BRANCHES, in the order the plan states them:

    1. item.failed        reopen it (if followup.auto_reopen_failures) or leave it
    2. gate mode 'agent'  today's QA spawn, behaviour unchanged
    3. gate mode 'builders'  the item is held in review; say so and do nothing
                          else — the chain staying blocked is that mode's point
    4. a chain successor became ready  emit chain.advanced so the handoff is
                          legible while it happens rather than inferred after
    5. done and nothing follows  the director debrief (opt-in, leashed)

PURE CORE, THREADED EDGE. :func:`decide` is a function of (events, settings,
board) returning a list of action dicts and does NO I/O — no database, no clock,
no settings read. :func:`snapshot` gathers the facts, :func:`apply_action`
performs them, :func:`tick` joins the three. ``qa_gate``'s tests have to call
``_scan_once`` directly *because* that module cannot be split that way, and the
bug that made those tests necessary (a placeholder/parameter mismatch) lived
inside the un-decomposable part for months.

DELIVERY IS AT-LEAST-ONCE, SO EVERY ACTION CARRIES A GUARD. A subscriber that
acts and then dies before its cursor lands acts again on restart: double QA
spawn, double debrief, double webhook, double reopen. ``events.cursor_set`` is
deliberately unversioned and best-effort for exactly that reason, which pushes
the responsibility here. Every action dict has a ``guard`` string and
:func:`apply_action` re-runs that guard as one query immediately before acting —
the same trick ``qa_gate._open_gate_exists`` has always used.

CATCHING UP IS NOT ALWAYS DESIRABLE. Eight hours down must not fire eight hours
of pings and debriefs. Notifications COLLAPSE on resume ("11 items finished while
you were away") and a debrief is SKIPPED past ``followup.max_age_min`` with one
notice instead of a spawn. A first run with no cursor starts at the head of the
log, not the beginning of history.

THE WEBHOOK IS THE ONLY THING HERE THAT LEAVES THE MACHINE, and it ships off. A
loopback service POSTing a user-supplied URL is an SSRF and an exfiltration path,
so: https only, no private or link-local addresses, one attempt, short timeout,
failures to the activity ledger. See :func:`webhook_target`.

"""Work history — what finished, how it finished, and who checked it.

THE GAP THIS FILLS. The Overview could say what is running and what just
happened, and nothing at all about what has been COMPLETED. 341 work items on
this project, 306 of them finished, and the only way to read the outcome of any
one of them was to page the queue by hand.

WHAT "VERDICT" MEANS HERE, precisely, because inventing one would be worse than
having none:

  A verdict is an INDEPENDENT judgement recorded against a work item. There are
  exactly three ways one gets written in this system, and this module reads all
  three rather than guessing:

  1. THE AGENT GATE (``bgate_ui.qa_gate``). A completed maker-seat item spawns a
     child work item with ``source='qa-gate'`` and ``source_ref`` = the reviewed
     item's id. That reviewer is instructed to write ``VERDICT: PASS`` or
     ``VERDICT: FAIL`` into its own result (qa_gate._brief_for). Only that marker
     is a verdict — a gate run that finished without writing one decided
     NOTHING, and reporting it as a pass is a gate that does not gate. The same
     rule is applied in the QA workspace (static/seats/qa.js); it is duplicated
     here rather than shared because the two read different shapes, but the
     regex and the UNKNOWN case are deliberately identical.
  2. THE ROUND CAP. Past ``qa.max_rounds`` the gate stops reviewing and files one
     ``source='qa-gate-escalation'`` item for the director. That is not a pass or
     a fail; it is "two agents could not agree and a human owes a call".
  3. THE BUILDER'S GATE. The human approves, which stamps ``approved_by`` and
     moves the item 'review' -> 'done' (queue.approve). An item still sitting in
     'review' has no verdict yet — it is waiting on the person reading this page.

  EVERYTHING ELSE HAS NO VERDICT, and this module says so in those words. Under
  ``gate.mode = none`` — which is what this project is set to — an agent's own
  word closes its item and nothing independent ever looks at it. The honest
  rendering of that is not a blank cell and it is certainly not a green tick: it
  is "closed on the agent's own word", with the evidence for that claim
  (``closed_by``, ``gate_skip``) attached. A UI that implies verification which
  did not happen is the exact failure the gate module exists to prevent.

WHY A ROUTER AND NOT app.py. Two reasons. Auto-registration (routes/__init__)
means no edit to a file three other people are in, and the log reader below
keeps its own index — it must NOT reuse ``dispatch.read_activity``, whose
``_feed_lock`` is held by the live console's 3-second poll. A historical log here
is 60MB (item-53); parsing one under that lock would stall every live agent
feed on the page.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What the run actually MADE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The complaint this answers, verbatim: "on overview agent work specifically
# art, i cant see the work generated". For an art item the deliverable is a
# picture, and the drawer showed the verdict, the prose and the transcript —
# everything except the picture.
#
# FOUR SOURCES, IN DESCENDING ORDER OF TRUST. None of them is invented storage;
# all four already existed and none was being read.
#
#   1. artifact_revision.work_item_id — the registry. Richest when present:
#      logical name, revision, review status, and the art path's machine verdict
#      in metadata.qa_review. Present for 11 items on the reference project and
#      NOT for the one that prompted this, which is why it cannot be the only
#      source.
#   2. bgate_core.writelog — `.bgate/writes/item-<id>.jsonl`, written by the
#      PreToolUse hook. THE HARNESS OBSERVED THESE; the agent does not get a
#      vote. It also already separates the project's own files from Builders
#      Gate's `.bgate/` bookkeeping, which is exactly the produced/incidental
#      split this panel needs and would otherwise have had to guess at.
#   3. The transcript's write-tool calls — the fallback for runs that predate
#      the write log. UNTRUSTED: these strings are agent output, so every one is
#      resolved and contained before it is allowed anywhere near a URL.
#   4. Captures under `.bgate_out/` — screenshots of the running game. Nothing
#      writes these to the database, so the only link back to the run is the
#      capture path appearing in that run's transcript, plus the naming
#      convention (`godot_screenshot` names files after the agent's own label).
#      Both are used and the UI says which one found a given frame.
#
# READS ARE COUNTED, NEVER LISTED. An agent reads an order of magnitude more
# than it writes and a combined list is noise — "distinguish produced from
# merely touched" is the whole point.

    THE BUG THIS SHAPE EXISTS TO AVOID, found on item #300: scanning the
    transcript for image paths finds every frame the agent READ as well as
    every frame it made, and #300's drawer duly offered another item's backdrop
    studies as its own output. A transcript mention proves contact, not
    authorship.

    So a frame has to clear one of two independent tests, and the UI says which:

      by name  — `godot_screenshot` names its file after the agent's label and
                 the seats tag it with the item (`item334_b_tut_carry`). The
                 digits carry a negative lookahead so item 33 cannot claim item
                 334's captures.
      by clock — the path is in this run's transcript AND the file was written
                 inside the run's own span. A reference image predates the run
                 by definition; a frame the run rendered cannot.

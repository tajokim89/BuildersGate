"""Every switch in one table — described, not moved.

Four features each added a switch in a different mechanism: a column on
``spend_budget``, a workspace doc, an env var read inline where it was needed,
and a module constant. Nothing listed them, nothing said which one the
environment was overriding, and adding the fifth meant editing a route, a
payload shape and a template. That pile is what this module deletes.

WHAT THIS IS NOT: a new store. Every :class:`Setting` carries a ``store``
locator pointing at where its value ALREADY lives, so upgrading changes no data
and no other module's reads. ``gate.mode`` is still the ``director/gate``
workspace doc; ``dispatch.max_concurrent`` is still the ``spend_budget`` row.
Move the storage and every existing reader silently starts reading a stale
value — the one failure mode a settings refactor cannot recover from.

The three stores, and why there are three rather than one:

    workspace   an existing per-seat JSON doc with its own established shape
                (``director/gate``, ``director/autopilot``). Versioned writes,
                so two tabs cannot erase each other.
    budget      a column on the single ``spend_budget`` row, because
                ``spend.check`` reads it on every dispatch and must keep
                reading exactly that.
    registry    the shared ``director/settings`` doc, for switches whose only
                previous home was a module constant. The registry default IS
                that constant's old value, so a project with no doc behaves
                identically to one that never upgraded.

PRECEDENCE IS env > stored > default, and :func:`describe` always reports which
one won. A panel that shows "agent" while ``BGATE_QA_GATE=0`` forces "none" is
the most expensive lie a settings surface can tell — somebody debugs the gate
for an hour before finding the shell profile.

TWO KINDS OF ENV OVERRIDE, because the vars that already exist are not one kind:

    env=NAME              the var SUPPLIES the value (BGATE_GIT_ISOLATION=1).
    env_coerce=(NAME, f)  the var FORCES a value (BGATE_QA_GATE=0 forces
                          gate.mode to "none").

Modelling the second as the first is a type mismatch: ``BGATE_QA_GATE`` is a
boolean kill switch and ``gate.mode`` is one of three strings, so a boolean
cannot be *read as* the value. Coercion wins over supply when both are set,
because a kill switch that loses to a preference is not a kill switch.

VALIDATION LIVES IN ONE PLACE (:func:`coerce`). Every writer — the settings
endpoint, the budget alias, the console's inline controls — goes through it, so
a range only has to be right once.

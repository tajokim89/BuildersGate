"""Who signs off before an agent's work counts as done.

THREE MODES, AND THE MIDDLE ONE IS WHAT SHIPPED BEFORE THIS FILE EXISTED.

    none      an agent's own word closes its item. Fastest, and the one that
              let a HUD ship with black boxes in it.
    agent     the QA seat reviews every maker-seat deliverable and reopens it
              with a nitpick list on FAIL (bgate_ui.qa_gate). Verification
              without a human in the loop.
    builders  the HUMAN approves. A finished item parks in 'review' and the
              chain behind it does not advance until somebody says yes.

The distinction that matters is not "strict vs loose", it is WHO IS AWAY. A
studio that wants to leave the board running overnight wants `agent`; a studio
that wants to watch each thing land wants `builders`; a studio iterating on
something it will look at anyway in ten seconds wants `none`. Forcing one of
those on the other two is how a gate ends up switched off wholesale, which is
the outcome every mode here exists to avoid.

WHY NOT BOTH (agent THEN human)? Because a queue of things waiting on a human is
only useful if the human actually drains it, and stacking two gates doubles the
latency on every item to buy a review the human is already doing by reading the
QA verdict. Deliberately not built; if it is ever wanted it is a fourth mode,
not a flag on this one.

PERSISTED PER PROJECT (workspace doc ``director/gate``), like auto-deploy, and
read fresh on every check so flipping it mid-run takes effect on the next item
rather than the next restart.

THE VALUE NOW COMES THROUGH ``bgate_core.settings`` (key ``gate.mode``), which
describes that same doc field — the storage did not move. What that buys is one
precedence rule and one validator: before it, the env kill switch was applied
here and nowhere else, so a settings panel listing "agent" while
``BGATE_QA_GATE=0`` forced "none" was a lie only this module could have caught.
Every public function below keeps its shape, including ``state()['env_override']``.

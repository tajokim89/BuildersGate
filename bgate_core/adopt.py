"""Point Builders Gate at a game that already exists.

`bgate init` scaffolds — it unpacks a template into an EMPTY directory and
refuses (without force) to touch anything else. That is correct for a new game
and useless for the person this tool keeps meeting: someone who already has a
Godot project, months of work in it, and a question ("what's missing?") that
needs the tool to READ their game rather than replace it.

So adoption is defined by what it will not do. It never copies a template file,
never passes force to the scaffolder, and never rewrites a byte a user wrote.
The only things it puts on disk are additive:

  .bgate/game.db   a new directory, or an existing one it updates in place
  .gitignore       APPENDED to, inside a marked block (the block exists because
                   the README tells you to keep your API key in .env next to
                   the game; without the ignore rule, following the README
                   commits the key)
  AGENTS.md        appended to, same marked-block trick

Both marked blocks make the whole operation idempotent: run adopt twice and the
second run finds its own marker and rewrites the block in place instead of
stacking a second copy.

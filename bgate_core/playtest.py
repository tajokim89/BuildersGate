"""Playtest sessions — record, transcribe, align, brief.

The whole design turns on one fact: **agents cannot watch video**. The mp4 is for
the human. What the team consumes is the aligned artifact — transcript, frames
pulled at the moments you spoke, and game telemetry joined on the same clock.
That join is what makes "the jump feels floaty" actionable: it lands next to the
actual jump event at that timestamp.

One clock: every t_* is SECONDS FROM SESSION START. Whisper timestamps are
relative to the wav, so audio_offset_s is added on ingest, once, here.

# a guess whisper made about a noisy mic.

# A note is an INSTANT, not a span. It gets t_end == t deliberately: the join
# window in brief() runs [t - window, t_end + window], and stretching t_end to

"""Session recording — game window video (ffmpeg gdigrab) + mic (sounddevice).

Two separate streams on one clock rather than one muxed ffmpeg command, because
the mic is the part that fails and it must fail LOUDLY and EARLY. ffmpeg's dshow
enumeration finds nothing on this machine, while sounddevice sees the devices
fine — so audio goes through sounddevice, which also lets us measure signal
before committing to a 20-minute recording.

The clock: every stream records its own wall-clock start. All downstream
timestamps are SECONDS FROM SESSION START, so transcript, frames, and telemetry
join on one axis.

# `gdigrab -i title=X` asks GDI for that window's device context. A Godot game
# does not draw into one: it renders through Vulkan/D3D and presents a swapchain
# the compositor owns, so GDI hands back the window's cleared background and
# nothing else. gdigrab then draws the mouse cursor on top itself — which is
# exactly the symptom, a black recording with a live cursor moving over it.
# Measured on this machine against the Godot editor: every pixel of a title=
# grab came back RGB(36,36,36), while a desktop grab of the same screen came
# back with a full 0-255 range.
#
# The composited desktop DOES have the game in it, because DWM has already
# flattened every GPU surface into it. So the capture is a desktop grab CROPPED
# to the window's rectangle, which keeps the reason the title targeting existed
# in the first place — an accidental desktop recording is somebody's inbox in a
# bug report — while capturing frames that are actually there.
#
# The alternative is ddagrab (Desktop Duplication API), which also works here
# and is cheaper on the GPU, but it needs a d3d11 hwdownload in the filter chain
# and fails outright over RDP and on some drivers. A cropped gdigrab has neither
# failure mode and needs nothing that is not already required.

    adding it to that origin. Subtracting the origin first put the crop a full
    monitor-width to the right on a machine whose second screen sits to the left
    of the primary, and ffmpeg refused the input rather than recording the wrong
    thing — "Capture area extends outside window area".

    The rectangle comes from DWM's extended frame bounds rather than
    ``GetWindowRect``, which since Windows 10 includes an invisible ~8px resize

    (-8,-8)-(1928,1040) for a window whose visible bounds are (0,0)-(1920,1032),

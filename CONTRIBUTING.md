# Contributing

This is a solo project, published because the ideas in it are worth arguing
about. **Feedback is worth more to me than patches right now.** The design is still
moving. A good bug report, or a "this concept does not survive contact with my
studio", is more useful than a merged diff.

## What is most useful

- **It did not run.** Setup failures beat everything else. If `pip install -e .`,
  `bgate doctor`, `bgate init` or `bgate serve` failed on your machine, that is
  the highest-value report there is. The quickstart is only ever verified on one
  machine.
- **The docs lie.** Anywhere the README or `docs/` describes behaviour the code
  does not have. Quote the line.
- **A gate that does not gate.** Any place a refusal (the cut line, seat lanes,
  asset locks, the budget, human-only approval) can be walked around. That class
  of bug is the point of the project, so it is the class I most want to hear
  about. Security-shaped findings go through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not a
  public issue.
- **It does not fit how you actually work.** Concept-level disagreement is
  welcome and does not need a repro.

Less useful: style preferences, dependency-addition proposals, and large
unsolicited refactors.

## Reporting a bug

Use the bug report form under **Issues**. Whatever route you take, include:

- **OS and version** (macOS 15, Windows 11, Ubuntu 24.04, ...)
- **Python version**, from `python -V`
- **`bgate doctor --json` output.** It answers "is the toolchain even here" in
  one pass, and most first-run reports are answered by it. It never prints your
  API key, only whether one is set.
- **What you ran, what you expected, what happened**, with the exact error text.

## Platform

**This checkout is verified on macOS for the browser dashboard, local Codex CLI,
Codex MCP registration, and Godot headless checks.** Some older subsystems and
release packaging still carry Windows-specific paths. Treat those as separate
compatibility surfaces, not the default local workflow.

Linux remains best-effort. CI runs there but marks it `continue-on-error`, and
tests that need platform-specific tooling skip cleanly.

## Running the tests

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest -m "not slow" -q
ruff check .
```

`-m "not slow"` deselects the tests that drive real Blender and real whisper.
Drop it only if you have both installed and want to wait. This is the same
command CI runs.

`ruff` is a merge gate and is pinned in the `dev` extra so your run and CI's
cannot disagree. The rule set is deliberately narrow — `E9` and `F`, which catch
bugs rather than taste — and is explained in `pyproject.toml`. A finding is
almost never a style opinion: turning it on found eight dead imports and
pointless f-strings on `main`, and a `NameError` waiting to happen in a branch
that had not landed yet.

If you are changing anything the wheel ships (JavaScript under
`bgate_ui/static/`, anything in `templates/`, the engine schemas), check the
wheel smoke test in the suite. A wheel that quietly ships no
JavaScript is a bug this repo has already had once. The full build-install-serve
loop is the `wheel-smoke` job in CI, and you can run it yourself:

```bash
python -m build --wheel
python -m venv .wheelenv && .wheelenv/bin/python -m pip install dist/*.whl
.wheelenv/bin/python packaging/smoke_wheel.py
```

## Pull requests

Small and focused, with the reasoning in the commit message. This codebase
comments *why*, not *what*, and is candid about its own failures; match that
voice rather than smoothing it out. New behaviour needs a test.
